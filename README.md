# php_blog_practice
It`s just a simple web site(blog). I created it just for practice.

**Mistakes in that project:**
	

 1. Completely wrong understanding of the MVC. User must interract with controller.  Wrong architecture of the project
 2. There is no routing 
 3. There are repetitions of the code
